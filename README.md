# To-Do List Application
# Overview
This is a simple To-Do List application built using Python and Tkinter. It allows users to add, update, remove, and display tasks through a graphical user interface (GUI). All tasks are saved to a JSON file for persistent storage.

# Features

Display Tasks: View all the tasks in a formatted list with task titles and due dates.

Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks with a title and due date.

Update Tasks: Existing tasks can be updated, including both title and due date.

Remove Tasks: Users can remove tasks by selecting the task number.

Persistent Storage: Tasks are saved in a tasks.json file, so they persist between application runs.

# Prerequisites

Python 3.x: Ensure Python is installed on your system.

Tkinter: Tkinter is typically included with Python, but you can install it via:

pip install tk

Run the Python file:

python todo.py

The To-Do List GUI will open, allowing you to interact with the tasks.

# Customization

You can easily modify the task properties and the way they are displayed by editing the Python code.

Add additional features such as task categories, priority levels, or task reminders by expanding the JSON structure.

# Dependencies

Tkinter: Used for the graphical interface.

JSON: Used for reading and writing task data.

# Future Improvements

Add functionality for setting task priorities or task categories.

Implement a task search feature.

Add notifications/reminders for tasks with upcoming due dates.

Improve the design and layout of the application for better user experience.
